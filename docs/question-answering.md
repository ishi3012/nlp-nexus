# Question Answering

The Question Answering (QA) system can understand and respond to user queries based on a given context.

## Getting Started

To set up the QA system:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
2. **Prepare Context**: Load or provide the context from which the system will answer questions.
3. **Ask Questions**: Use the provided interface to ask questions and receive answers.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how to perform question answering:

```python
from nlp_nexus import question_answering

context = "The capital of France is Paris."
question = "What is the capital of France?"
answer = question_answering.get_answer(context, question)
print(answer)
