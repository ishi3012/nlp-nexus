**2. Prepare Data**

Make sure your data is in a compatible format. Supported formats include:

- **CSV: For structured data with labeled columns.**
- **JSON: For unstructured or hierarchical data.**

Ensure your data is preprocessed as needed (e.g., text cleaning, tokenization).

**3. Run Analysis**

Use the provided scripts or functions to analyze the sentiment of your text data. The example below demonstrates how to use the sentiment analysis feature from the nlp_nexus package:
