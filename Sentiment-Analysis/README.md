# Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

The Sentiment Analysis project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification of textual data. This project includes data processing, model training, evaluation, and reporting components. It is part of the larger `nlp-nexus` repository, which encompasses various NLP tasks.

## Project Structure

The `Sentiment-Analysis` directory is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains raw, processed, and external datasets.
  - `raw/`: Original, unmodified data.
  - `processed/`: Data that has been cleaned and preprocessed.
  - `external/`: Data from external sources.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and reporting.
  - `data-exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring and visualizing the data.
  - `model-training.ipynb`: Notebook for training sentiment analysis models.
  - `model-evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for evaluating model performance.
  - `sentiment-analysis-report.ipynb`: Notebook for generating analysis reports.

- `models/`: Stores trained models and pre-trained models.
  - `saved-models/`: Directory for models saved during training.
  - `pretrained-models/`: Directory for pre-trained models used for transfer learning.

- `src/`: Source code for the project.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `src` package.
  - `data_processing.py`: Scripts for processing and cleaning data.
  - `model.py`: Defines the sentiment analysis model architecture.
  - `train.py`: Scripts for training the model.
  - `evaluate.py`: Scripts for evaluating the model's performance.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project.

- `tests/`: Unit tests for source code modules.
  - `test_data_processing.py`: Tests for data processing functions.
  - `test_model.py`: Tests for the model components.
  - `test_utils.py`: Tests for utility functions.

- `config/`: Configuration files.
  - `config.yaml`: Configuration settings for the project.

- `logs/`: Directory for log files generated during training and evaluation.

- `results/`: Directory for storing results and outputs from the model evaluation.

- `references/`: Contains literature and research papers related to sentiment analysis.
  - `papers/`: Directory for storing academic papers.
    - `sentiment_analysis_literature.pdf`: A collection of relevant literature on sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-nexus.git
   cd nlp-nexus/Sentiment-Analysis

## Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Preparation: 
Place your raw data in the data/raw/ directory and preprocess it using the provided scripts or notebooks. Follow the instructions in the data-exploration.ipynb notebook for initial data exploration.

## Training the Model: 
Use the model-training.ipynb notebook or run the train.py script to train your sentiment analysis model. Adjust the configurations in config/config.yaml as needed.

## Evaluating the Model: 
Evaluate the performance of your model using the model-evaluation.ipynb notebook or the evaluate.py script. Review the results in the results/ directory.

## Generating Reports: 
Use the sentiment-analysis-report.ipynb notebook to generate and visualize analysis reports based on your model's performance.
