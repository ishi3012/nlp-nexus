# NLP Nexus

## Overview

NLP Nexus is a comprehensive portfolio of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, designed to demonstrate various techniques and applications in the field of NLP. This repository contains implementations, analyses, and tools for the following projects:

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify and understand emotions in text data.
- **Question Answering:** Build systems to provide precise answers based on context.
- **ChatGPT Conversational Agent:** Develop conversational agents using state-of-the-art language models.
- **Machine Translation:** Translate text between languages with high accuracy.
- **Text Summarization:** Generate concise summaries from longer documents.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `docs/`: Documentation for each project.
- `nlp_nexus/`: Main package directory with submodules for each NLP project.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for various modules.
- `examples/`: Example scripts demonstrating usage of each module.
- `config/`: Configuration files for different projects.
- `logs/`: Log files generated during execution.
- `results/`: Outputs and model artifacts from experiments.
- `references/`: Literature and papers relevant to the projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this package, you'll need to have Python installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

cd nlp-nexus
pip install .
```

### Usage
#### Sentiment Analysis
```bash
from nlp_nexus.sentiment_analysis.model import SentimentModel

model = SentimentModel()
result = model.predict("I love NLP!")
print(result)
```

#### Question Answering
```bash
from nlp_nexus.question_answering.model import QuestionAnsweringModel

qa_model = QuestionAnsweringModel()
answer = qa_model.answer_question("What is NLP?", context="NLP stands for Natural Language Processing.")
print(answer)
```

#### ChatGPT Conversational Agent
```bash
from nlp_nexus.chatgpt_conversational_agent.model import ChatGPTAgent

agent = ChatGPTAgent()
response = agent.chat("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
```

#### Machine Translation
```bash
from nlp_nexus.machine_translation.model import TranslationModel

translator = TranslationModel()
translated_text = translator.translate("Hello, how are you?", target_language="es")
print(translated_text)
```

#### Text Summarization
```bash
from nlp_nexus.text_summarization.model import SummarizationModel

summarizer = SummarizationModel()
summary = summarizer.summarize("Long text document goes here.")
print(summary)
```
